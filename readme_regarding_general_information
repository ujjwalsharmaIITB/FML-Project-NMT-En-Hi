When you have Classifier defined directly in a file you run,
it's pickled as coming from the module main. When you unpickle it in the web app,
there is no main module, so the code can't find the definition.
If you create the classifier in it's own module that you import in both places, then it should work.

Now if you want to unpickle then you need to make the class that have the definations as
part of __main__ 
to do this you need to point and not defile the same classes in the main file

you can see this in encoder_decoder.py code

had to add the following:

import __main__

def getImages(d): return##

__main__.getImages = getImages
